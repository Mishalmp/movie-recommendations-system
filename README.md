# üìΩÔ∏è Movie Recommendation System using Ploomber and DuckDB

This project is a **modular and scalable Movie Recommendation System** built using [Ploomber](https://ploomber.io/) for pipeline orchestration and [DuckDB](https://duckdb.org/) for efficient in-process analytics. It demonstrates how modern data tools can be combined to build a **fast, lightweight, and reproducible machine learning pipeline** for content-based movie recommendations.

## üîß Tech Stack

- **Ploomber** ‚Äì For defining, orchestrating, and running modular data pipelines.
- **DuckDB** ‚Äì An in-process SQL OLAP database optimized for analytical workloads.
- **Python** ‚Äì Core language for data processing and modeling.
- **scikit-learn** ‚Äì For building and training the recommendation model.
- **FastAPI** ‚Äì For serving the model via a lightweight REST API (if included).
- **Docker** ‚Äì For containerized deployment and reproducibility.

## üí° Features

- Cleans and transforms raw movie metadata.
- Generates movie embeddings using TF-IDF on genres, overviews, and more.
- Computes cosine similarity for movie recommendations.
- Returns top-N similar movies for a given title.
- Powered by SQL queries on DuckDB for fast, memory-efficient processing.
- Modular pipeline with Ploomber for easy debugging, testing, and extension.

## üöÄ Use Case

This system is ideal for:
- Small to medium-scale movie recommendation tasks
- Educational purposes in data science and ML pipelines
- A starting point for building more advanced recommender systems using collaborative filtering or deep learning
